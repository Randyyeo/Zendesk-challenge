In this project, I created a **Ticket Viewer** with the main aim of connecting to the Zendesk API and displaying the relevant tickets that will be displayed for the end-user. This project was created using Vue.js, Express.js and bootstrap.


## Installation

Clone the repository or download the zip file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Randyyeo/Zendesk-challenge.git
```

Go to the folder of the files in your local and use the package manager npm to install the dependencies for both the ticker folder and the backend folder.

```bash
cd Ticket
npm install 
```

```bash
cd backend
npm install 
```

## Run both applications

Ticket
```bash
npm run serve
```

Backend
```bash
nodemon app.js
```
